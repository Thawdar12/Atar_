Project: Shape Management System 
About: This Shape Management System lets users create 2D shapes, compute areas, analyze points, and sort or view detailed reports. With a menu-driven interface and object-oriented design, it efficiently manages shapes for geometric analysis and educational use.

What I learnt
- OOP principles: Polymorphism and absteact class, Encapsulation, Dynamic Memory Management
- Algorithm and Logic: Area calculation, sorting, filtering
- Error Handling
- User Interaction: Menu-driven design, Input Validation
- C++: STL usage, I/O Manipulation, Function Pointer and Lambdas
